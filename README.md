Aggregator for compton runs. Runs must be grouped into snails. Code does NOT work without functional CompMon install and environment variables set properly.

To work: create a file in the snails/ folder give a name snail<snail number>.list. The file should contain one or more run numbers each on its own line.

Then run aggregateGrand.C with the snail number as an argument. Plots will be created and uploaded to $COMPMON_WEB.

Minirun files are currently disused.
